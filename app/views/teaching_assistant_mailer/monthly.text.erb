TA Sign Ups - and a new system!

Hello <%= @ta['name'] %>! One of the most time-consuming aspects of GDI Chicago's daily operations is coordinating with our volunteer TAs. It takes a lot of time to make that silly momthly sign up for and send out emails to everyone who signed up. The entire sign up process is now completely automated!

This orientation email contains all sorts of information about how to sign up, earning class credit, and reminder emails, and some info about upcoming classes. Future emails won't be this long, promise!

Additional course information is below, and can also be found on your private sign up page.

*** About the new system ***

* Emails

You will receive emails:

* Once a month, with information about classes you can sign up for
* A reminder email one-two weeks prior to a class you signed up for, including detailed information about the location

And that's it! No other emails, we promise.

-----------------------------------

* Credit hours

After you TA 4 complete classes for Girl Develop It Chicago, you are eligible to accumulate credit hours that can be used toward upcoming classes. Each class or session will list the number of credit hours you can earn for TA'ing. Usually, credit hours are earned as a 2:1 ratio, but some classes are worth more or less, depending on the nature of the material.

We don't expect everyone to take us up on this offer, but some of our TAs have expressed interest in taking classes, and we wanted to make it possible to us to reward you for your hard work.

The terms for using credit hours are as follows:

* Credit hours can only be used to cover the full cost of the class (no discounts or partial payment)
* One credit hour == one hour of instruction time (or about $10)
* You can only use credit hours you've earned: pending credit hours aren't available to spend, and you can't go into credit hour debt
* We carefully manage class capacity, and sometimes we might not have a spot for you (but we'll try our best to fit you in)
* To qualify to accumulate credit hours, you must TA 4 complete courses. For single-day workshops, this is pretty clear. For multi-session courses, you must TA for all of the sessions in order for it to count toward the minimum TA requirement.

To use credit hours, contact chicago@girldevelopit.com directly.
